      "summary": "Angels and Demons is a mystery thriller by Dan Brown. The story begins with the murder of physicist Leonardo Vetra at the CERN research facility in Switzerland. Vetra’s body is found branded with a mysterious symbol, and Robert Langdon, a Harvard symbologist, is called to investigate. He discovers that Vetra had been working on antimatter, a highly volatile substance, which has gone missing. Langdon learns that the Illuminati, an ancient secret society that opposes the Catholic Church, has stolen the antimatter and plans to use it to destroy Vatican City during the Papal Conclave, a major event where a new pope is to be elected. Langdon teams up with Vetra’s daughter, Vittoria, to solve the puzzle. Together, they race against time, traveling through Rome and deciphering clues hidden in famous works of art, religious symbols, and architecture. As they uncover a deadly conspiracy, they are hunted by a mysterious assassin. The pair must navigate a web of religious history, scientific discovery, and deep-rooted secrets to stop the Illuminati’s plan. The novel explores themes of science versus religion and the power of secret societies in shaping history. The final twist challenges the characters' beliefs and forces readers to question the balance between faith and reason."

      "title": "Blind Spot: Why Science Cannot Ignore Human Experience",
      "author": "Adam Frank, Marcelo Gleiser, and Evan Thompson",
      "genre": "Philosophy",
      "coverImage": "/images/images (4).jpeg",
      "summary": "Blind Spot is a thought-provoking exploration of the limitations of the scientific method in fully understanding human experience. The authors argue that science, while incredibly powerful in explaining the physical world, falls short in addressing the intricacies of consciousness, emotions, and subjective experiences. By delving into philosophy, spirituality, and the humanities, the authors propose a more integrative approach to understanding the full spectrum of human existence. They challenge the notion that science can provide all the answers, advocating for a broader perspective that includes diverse ways of knowing. The book is a call to recognize the importance of subjective experience and the interconnectedness of various fields of knowledge, ultimately seeking a more comprehensive understanding of what it means to be human."

Waking up in a hospital in Florence, Italy, with no memory of the past 36 hours, Langdon is soon thrust into a mysterious plot involving a bioterrorist threat. Working alongside Dr. Sienna Brooks, a brilliant doctor, Langdon discovers that a bio-weapon designed to reduce the world's population has been hidden, and its activation is imminent. The key to finding this weapon lies in the cryptic clues embedded in Dante's Inferno — the first part of The Divine Comedy, which explores the nine circles of Hell. Langdon and Sienna race across historical cities in Italy, facing increasingly dangerous adversaries, as they try to decode the verses and symbols leading to the weapon's location. As they navigate through stunning landmarks like the Florence Cathedral and the Palazzo Vecchio, Langdon and Sienna uncover secrets that challenge their understanding of the modern world and the very future of humanity. The novel climaxes in a shocking twist, revealing the true nature of the plot and forcing Langdon to make a life-altering decision."
